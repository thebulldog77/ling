Wintermute Linguistics (WntrLing)
============================================

1. About WntrLing

This set of code represents the very unique and very intricately designed code
portraying Wintermute's ability to understand and interpret language. Being that
there isn't only one language known to human beings, the system set in place by
this NLP engine is capable of handling multiple languages, possibly
simultaneously as well. This is the future of natural language processing.

2. Current Status

The current, live status of WntrLing is mainly known to Jacky Alcine
<jacky.alcine@thesii.org>. It's because he works on this sect of code extremely
closely as well as tying loose ends with WntrData to ensure everything flows
nicely. Contact him if you're interested in finding out the latest update on
this branch. Information is typically available in the commit message.
