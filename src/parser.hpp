         * @section N01 The Process
         * @subsection N02 Santizating the Text
         * Wintermute goes through a partly intricate means of ensuring the real
         * meaning of text is preserved while it's still made <b>legible</b> to the
         * system for detection. Towards the close of santizating, a collection of
         * Token objects are created and are passed in a TokenList for ease of use.
         * @see Token, TokenList
         *
         * @subsection N03 Detecting Words in the Text
         * Now, after santizating has been done; we now look at each token in the TokenList
         * and determine the possible Node that's been represented by the token. Note that
         * we aren't looking for the <i>meaning</i> of the word just yet; we're merely
         * attempting to <i>recognize</i> the word being displayed. This is then packed
         * into a NodeList and is used for expansion.
         * @see Node, NodeList
         *
         * @subsection N04 Expanding into Paths
         * In some languages, one word can have multiple values. Some languages don't have
         * this issue, but other languages (like English or other Romance languages) tend
         * to have words that when put in a sentence, hold an ambigious meaning. Such ambiguity
         * is hard to iron out and is currently (but partly) tackled by <b>expansion</b>.
         * Expansion is the act of Wintermute detecting the number of potential nodes in a word.
         * For example, the English sentence, "<b>We are boys</b>", can be represented as:
         * @dot
            digraph L {
                    graph [layout=dot rankdir=RL]

                    {"We"} -> {"are"} -> {"boys"}
            }

         * @enddot
         * However, the words 'We' and 'are' have more than one potential meaning in English,
         * as shown below; thus creating an ambiguity in the sentence. Is it referring to the
         * third person as a collection of individuals as an object (We)? Is it referring to
         * the second person or the third person (are)?
         * @dot
            digraph L {
                    graph [layout=dot rankdir=TB]

                    {"We"} -> {"We-1"}

         * @enddot
         * Wintermute now goes through each path and pushes the path (not its potential Meaning) to the
         * back of a NodeTree. These trees are used for the transversion.
         * @see Node, NodeList, NodeTree
         *
         * @subsection N05 Transversing a Tree
         * The act of Wintermute transversing over a tree is simply the back-to-back interpretation of
         * similar sentences and then determining which sentence is more approriate for the current context.
         * Currently, context-detection isn't in order, so only the sentences that are grammatically correct
         * and return an equivalency of its originating form are pushed to the back of a MeaningList and
         * passed over to the interpretation handle.
         * @see Meaning, Binding, Rule, BindingList, RuleList, MeaningList
         *
         * @subsection N06 Interpretating Information
         * After the lexicosyntactic representation (a Meaning object) of each valid sentence
         * has been found, we transverse once more over this list to determine the potential
         * <b>interpretation</b> of said objects. This is done by rendering the objects as
         * ontological concepts and from there, generating a list of valid ontologic objects
         * to be executed.
         *
         * @subsection N07 Execution
         * Execution is done very similarly to how a typical computer program would be done.
         * Currently, Wintermute would go about exeuction by discovering all of the required
         * ontological concepts to be used by the concept (most, if not all, of which should be
         * already loaded during the interpretation phase) and saturating the concept to hold
         * its inherited attributes, in a fashion to how a program would external symbols from
         * shared libraries at load-time. From there, the head-link of the Meaning object is used to go about the execution
         * process. For example, if a sentence said, "My name is Jacky"; it'd discover the
         * means of finding out if first the statement is logically true, on a scale, using fuzzy logic
         * (http://en.wikipedia.org/Fuzzy_logic), of 0 to 1 (0% to 100%). The higher the rating,
         * the more confidient Wintermute is about the statement. If confidient enough, it then
         * generates an approriate response.
         *
         * @endsection
         * There's a pantheon of errors, mistakes and complications that haven't been calculated
         * currently into the coding that could cause subtle exceptions in interpretation, execution
         * or even santization that'd mess up the potential output of Wintermute.
         *
         * @attention Using Big O notation, the parser avoids running into memory intenstive operations. The typical execution size is O(n1) * ...  * O(n(x)).
         *            Typically words have only one to three definitions. But if a sentence has words with 6 different meangins and there's 40 words; things get hairy <b>fast</b>.
